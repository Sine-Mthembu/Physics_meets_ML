## Predictive Maintenance using Deep Neural Networks
### **Project 1**
This notebook explores a binary classification task to predict machine failure using sensor data such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. It includes data preprocessing (scaling, encoding), feature importance analysis with RFE, and model training using a deep neural network implemented in Keras. Performance evaluation includes classification metrics, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and probability distributions. Class imbalance is addressed using techniques like class weighting and SMOTE to improve recall for failure prediction.
